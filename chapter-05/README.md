# Chapter 5: Using Higher-Order Functions

Chapter 5 talks about higher-order functions and their usage. Higher-order functions are those that contain functions as arguments and that return functions as their results, another important feature within Elixir and functional programming.

There is also a section devoted to lazy evaluation in Elixir, which is used to write components that will be evaluated later. The major Elixir component discussed here is Elixir's pipe operator, which allows for cleaner and more readable code.

As always, the exercises from the end of the chapter are in the exercises folder.
