# Chapter 7: Handling Impure Functions

The final chapter of this book is about impure functions vs. pure functions, a very important concept in functional programming. Impure functions are unpredictable functions that can return different values for the same inputs. Pure functions are the opposite of them, they are predictable.

Because handling impure functions is the topic of the chapter, I'll also be learning about how to handle errors in this chapter, since impure functions can oftentimes return some sort of error.

Again, in this chapter there are no explicit exercises. There are suggestions to change the dungeon crawl application from containing impure functions to pure functions, but once again, I'll probably attempt to do this at a later point in time.
