# Chapter 6: Designing Your Elixir Applications

Up until now, the book has been showing me various concepts in functional programming and features of the Elixir language. I've been working in one off modules and scripts that are not properly structured like a typical Elixir application.

In this chapter, I will be creating a fully fledged application using Elixir. I'll be learning about using protocols (and implementing them in structs), using behaiours (and implementing them on modules), and using Dialyzer for static type checking.

The application I'm building throughout the chapter will be a terminal based dungeon crawl game, where a player needs to walk through a dungeon, avoid any bad things, get any good things, and reach the exit without dying. Classic RPG style.

There are no real exercises at the end of the chapter here, just a list of possible ideas to implement in the continued development of the game. For right now, I won't be continuing in developing that, I'll leave that for later when I have some extra time.
