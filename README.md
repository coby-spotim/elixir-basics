# Elixir Basics

This repository will contain code that I write while reading through the book Learn Functional Programming With Elixir.

The book was given to me by the new company that I am working with, called Spot.IM, in order to prepare me before I officially start working there. They also gave me cookies! Isn't that awesome??

The book contains examples and exercises to complete while reading it. I'll be creating a folder for each chapter that I read to contain the code that I write for that chapter.
