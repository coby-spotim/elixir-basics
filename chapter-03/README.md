# Chapter 3: Using Pattern Matching to Control the Program Flow

Chapter 3 details one of the core parts of the Elixir language, pattern matching, and using it to control the flow of a program. There are lots of details about how pattern matching works, how to use it with lists, tuples, maps, structs, and keyword lists. The last sections of the chapter are about guard clauses control flow, which helps you control the flow of the program (fairly self explanatory from the name, no?).

Again, the exercises from the end of the chapter are in the exercises folder.
